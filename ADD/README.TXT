PROJECT TITLE: Productadder
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To add products to channeladvisor US and CA, as well as vend and Kounta
VERSION or DATE: May 24, 2017
AUTHORS: Sinclair Hudson
USER INSTRUCTIONS: If not compiled, run Main.main() to start the program

Specification:
Program inputs, through multiple text fields, all the required elements to list a product online.
The products with their info are then exported to .csv format or .xlsx, to be uploaded to CA by use of
FTP. Three spreadsheets will be created, for Vend, Channeladvisor US, and ChannelAdvisor CA.
Images will be uploaded seperately by FTP, hopefully linked to the product immediately after
upload. Parent and Children skus will be linked upon upload, with significant shortcuts to create
child products through the program.
